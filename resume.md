#  Projects

##  Rusyn Wordle
Developed and deployed responsive word game web-app featuring interactive game board and on-screen Cyrillic keyboard. Showcases proficiency in front-end development with HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS, plus basic back-end development and database management skills with PostgreSQL and PHP. Git employed extensively for revision tracking and sourcing bugs from community.

Utilizes modular object model including an extensive config file and configurable game board class allowing adjustable board size and difficulty level. A SQL query was implemented in PHP to retrieve a new daily word simultaneously for users across the globe from a PostgreSQL database, preventing viewing of the whole list via user dev console.
