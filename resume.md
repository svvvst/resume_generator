#  Projects

##  Rusyn Wordle
Developed and deployed responsive word game web-app featuring interactive game board and on-screen Cyrillic keyboard. Showcases of proficiency in front-end development with HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS, plus basic back-end development and database management skills with PostgreSQL and PHP. Git employed extensively for revision tracking and sourcing bug from community.

Utilizes modular object model including an extensive config file and configurable game board class allowing adjustable board size and difficulty level. A SQL query was implemented in PHP to retrieve a new daily word simultaneously for users across the globe from a PostgreSQL database, preventing viewing of the whole list via user dev console.

##  Trumbeta.me
Digital Ocean-hosted Mastodon server marketed towards speakers of minority European language. Applied technical expertise in Linux administration, shell scripting, and remote development.

Installed, configured, and managed entire Ubuntu software stack including Ruby, PostgreSQL, nginx. Utilized scripting languages, e.g. Bash and Ruby, to automate server maintenance, along with CLI tools i.e. crontab.
