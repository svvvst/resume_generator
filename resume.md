##  United Parcel Service, Inc.
###  Industrial Engineer
####  Melville, NY • 09/2017 - 02/2019

##### Conveyor Deployment
- Deployed new automated conveyor system, coordinating with a wide range of business groups including plant engineering, corporate technology group, and OEM to understand project goals and design, then carry out operation plan development, operational integration, conveyor configuration, testing, analysis, on-time delivery, and operations support.

###### Sorting
- Reduced conveyor mis-sorts by 170 packages per day by conducting package flow simulation modeling in VBA and developing an algorithm that organized sort layout into equal-volume sets based on queried historical metrics, reducing operator strain and improving user experience.
###### Operations
- Developed operation manual for automated conveyor including daily setup, area maintenance, safety, and staffing procedures.
- Worked side-by-side with operators to train personnel on corporate conveyor operations methodology, safety and maintenance.
###### Failure Analysis
- Identified root causes and resolved numerous automated scanning and mechanical issues with new conveyor system with assistance from plant engineering, corporate technology group, and OEM.
- Collected data on, analyzed, identified root causes of, and resolved numerous scanning and mechanical conveyor system bugs.

##### Data Model
- Built comprehensive Jet SQL data model in MS Access, applying self-taught skills to mine, cleanse, and integrate data from several disconnected relational databases (Oracle, Microsoft) and scraped intranet sites; facilitating more complex reporting and in-depth investigations.
- Transformed data from data model to ID late-arriving package accounts, author report on tardy package arrival causes, then revise pickup 
- Deployed revised pickup schedules for high-volume, local accounts, pushing operational peak volume back 40 minutes.

##### Data Analysis
- Created Power BI dashboard tool for distribution to other district hubs to visualize real-time trailer from queried scan data. 
- Performed capacity & demand analysis and projections for operations planning based on historical performance data; applying statistical methods such as: linear regressions, fast Fourier transform, SMAs, std. dev., etc.
- Developed daily operating plans for projected daily operation performance/staffing requirements based on basic statistical analysis of historical service demand and operational performance metrics: linear regressions, sinusoidal regressions, moving averages, standard deviation, variance, etc.

##### Other
- Wrote and rolled out special operating plans for new Saturday sort operation, working closely with hub and package operations groups.
- Provided knowledge, resources, tools, and advice to fellow industrial engineering team members regarding how to leverage technologies such as SQL, MS Excel, or Access to simplify rote day-to-day activities and gain access to otherwise-hidden business insights.

#  Projects

##  Rusyn Wordle
Developed and deployed responsive word game web-app featuring interactive game board and on-screen Cyrillic keyboard. Showcases proficiency in front-end development with HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS, plus basic back-end development and database management skills with PostgreSQL and PHP. Git employed extensively for revision tracking and sourcing bugs from community.

Utilizes modular object model including an extensive config file and configurable game board class allowing adjustable board size and difficulty level. A SQL query was implemented in PHP to retrieve a new daily word simultaneously for users across the globe from a PostgreSQL database, preventing viewing of the whole list via user dev console.

##  Trumbeta.me
Digital Ocean-hosted Mastodon server marketed towards speakers of minority European language. Applied technical expertise in Linux administration, shell scripting, and remote development.

Installed, configured, and managed entire Ubuntu software stack including Ruby, PostgreSQL, nginx. Utilized scripting languages, e.g. Bash and Ruby, to automate server maintenance, along with CLI tools i.e. crontab.
