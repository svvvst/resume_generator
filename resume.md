# Objective
Motivated and results-driven engineer with experience in mining data and transforming it into actual process improvements and project successes. With a strong analytical mindset, problem-solving abilities, and broad technical expertise in multiple programming languages, SQL, and data visualization, I'm eager to leverage my abilities and experience in navigating multi-disciplinary environments to drive decision making and inform a user experience that converts user interaction into further monetization opportunities.

# Construction Support (C.S.) Coordinator, LIRR 3rd Track Expansion Project
- Designed and leveraged ad-hoc and automated reports/visualizations in Excel, Power BI, and Power Query Formula Language, to highlight performance trends and drive data-based process optimization opportunities.
- Leveraged KPI analytics to coordinate a cross-functional assortment of teams to meet deadlines for hundreds of product/RFI reviews each month, satisfying design contract; drawing on extensive knowledge of project subject-matter experts, specs, and structure to do so.
- Built VBA recommendation algorithm that reduced submittal distribution time from 12 to 3 min. avg. by parsing email keywords with RegEx, then applying boolean algebra prescribed in config file.
- Cut document management process from 10 minute to 2 minute average with VBA and JavaScript programming; scraping the web-based document system, sorting files, adding data to local database.

# Industrial Engineer, UPS
- Deployed new automated conveyor system and conducted root cause analyses based on data and in-field research to resolve numerous scanning and mechanical issues with new conveyor system; coordinating with plant engineering, corporate technology group, and OEM.
- Improved conveyor accuracy by 170 packages per day by developing Excel VBA algorithm to organize sort layout into equal-volume sets based on monthly statistics.
- Developed daily, monthly, and yearly projections based on historical service demand and past operational performance metrics, applying basic statistical analysis in the process: linear regressions, fast Fourier transform, simple moving averages, standard deviation, etc.
- Created Power BI dashboard to visualize real-time trailer volumes from queried scan data. 
- Authored report on tardy package arrival causes, employing data from Oracle database to pinpoint late-arriving accounts and revise pickup schedules, pushing operational peak volume back 40 minutes.
- Built comprehensive data model with Jet SQL in MS Access, integrating data from databases, data warehouses, and intranet sites using self-taught SQL, Access, and Power BI skills
- Provided resources and advice to fellow industrial engineering team members regarding how to leverage technologies such as MS Excel or Access to simplify rote day-to-day activities and gain access to otherwise-hidden business insights.

# Consolidated Edison, Inc., Engineering Design Co-op
- Compiled data, conducted cost-benefit analysis, and determined ROI by using metrics collected on employee injuries, typical man-hour/overtime costs, and evaluating these against projected post-implementation improvements to process and health/safety to.
- Conducted surveys of end-users and interviews of stakeholders to gather insights, which were then translated into actionable project specifications to ensure project and goals met user needs and aligned with business strategy.
