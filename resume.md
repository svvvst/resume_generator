- Deployed new automated conveyor system and conducted root cause analyses based on data and in-field research to resolve numerous scanning and mechanical issues with new conveyor system; coordinating with plant engineering, corporate technology group, and OEM.
- Improved conveyor accuracy by 170 packages per day by developing Excel VBA algorithm to organize sort layout into equal-volume sets based on monthly statistics.
- Developed daily, monthly, and yearly projections based on historical service demand and past operational performance metrics, applying basic statistical analysis in the process: linear regressions, fast Fourier transform, simple moving averages, standard deviation, etc.
- Created Power BI dashboard to visualize real-time trailer volumes from queried scan data. 
- Authored report on tardy package arrival causes, employing data from Oracle database to pinpoint late-arriving accounts and revise pickup schedules, pushing operational peak volume back 40 minutes.
- Built comprehensive data model with Jet SQL in MS Access, integrating data from databases, data warehouses, and intranet sites using self-taught SQL, Access, and Power BI skills
- Provided resources and advice to fellow industrial engineering team members regarding how to leverage technologies such as MS Excel or Access to simplify rote day-to-day activities and gain access to otherwise-hidden business insights.

###  Industrial Engineering Intern
#### Uniondale, NY / 10/2017 - 02/18

## Consolidated Edison, Inc.
###  Engineering Design Co-op
####  New York, NY / 01/2016 - 12/2016
- Compiled data, conducted cost-benefit analysis, and determined ROI by using metrics collected on employee injuries, typical man-hour/overtime costs, and evaluating these against projected post-implementation improvements to process and health/safety to.
- Conducted surveys of end-users and interviews of stakeholders to gather insights, which were then translated into actionable project specifications to ensure project and goals met user needs and aligned with business strategy.
