# Experience

##  Radin Consulting, Inc.
###  Construction Support Coordinator, CTA Red-Purple Modernization Project
####  Remote / 08/2020 – 02/2021
###  Construction Support (C.S.) Coordinator, LIRR 3rd Track Expansion Project
####  Westbury, NY  / 02/2019 - 08/2020
- Leveraged KPI analytics to coordinate multi-disciplinary assortments of teams and meet deadlines for hundreds of product/RFI reviews each month, satisfying design contract; drawing on extensive knowledge of project subject-matter experts, specs, and structure to do so.
- Built recommendation algorithm in VBA that reduced submittal distribution time from 12 to 3 min. avg. by parsing email keywords with RegEx, then applying boolean algebra according to config file.
- Designed and leveraged ad-hoc and automated reports in Excel, Power BI, and Power Query Formula Language, to highlight performance trends and innovate process optimization opportunities.
- Identified and resolved issues during the review process, and coordinated with various teams and contractors to do so.
- Published personal organizational documentation to facilitate more direct communication between teams, increase adherence to review guidelines, and accelerate onboarding of fellow C.S. team members.
- Negotiated RFI costs with contractors at monthly meetings.

##  United Parcel Service, Inc.
###  Industrial Engineer
####  Melville, NY /  09/2017 - 02/2019
- Developed daily operating plans for projected daily operation performance/staffing requirements based on basic statistical analysis of historical service demand and operational performance metrics: linear regressions, sinusoidal regressions, moving averages, standard deviation, variance, etc.
- Authored report and presentation on tardy package arrival causes, employing data from several databases to pinpoint late-arriving accounts and prescribe revised pickup schedules for high-volume, local accounts as a solution.
- Optimized operator experience and improved conveyor accuracy by 170 packages per day by developing Excel VBA algorithm to organize sort layout into equal-volume sets based on monthly statistics.
- Built comprehensive data model with Jet SQL in MS Access, integrating data from databases, data warehouses, and intranet sites using self-taught SQL, Access, and Power BI skills
- Provided resources and advice to fellow industrial engineering team members particularly on how to leverage technologies such as MS Excel or Access to simplify rote day-to-day activities and gain access to otherwise-hidden business insights.
###  Industrial Engineering Intern
#### Uniondale, NY / 10/2017 - 02/18

## Consolidated Edison, Inc.
###  Engineering Design Co-op
####  New York, NY / 01/2016 - 12/2016
- Managed design team and development of $65,000 conveyor: set schedule, assigned tasks, reviewed team members' progress, etc.
- Compiled data, conducted cost-benefit analysis, and determined ROI by using metrics collected on employee injuries, typical man-hour/overtime costs, and evaluating these against projected post-implementation improvements to process and health/safety to.
- Conducted surveys of end-users and interviews of stakeholders to gather insights, which were then translated into actionable project specifications to ensure project and goals met user needs and aligned with business strategy.
- Designed conveyor support structure and organized 150+ part assembly in Solidworks
- Evaluated and revised structural and mechanical integrity of support structure and individual components with Finite Element Analysis in Solidworks Sim. and traditional analytical methods in Excel and MATLAB, while also working with internal structural engineers to ensure compliance with company design guidelines.
