Hi Tracey,

I found your profile through search and wanted to reach out personally to introduce myself as I just applied for a Product Analyst role at SiriusXM located in NYC yesterday and I'm very excited for the opportunity to bring my well-rounded analytical background to the team. 

With a mechanical engineering degree and experience in both industrial engineering and construction management, I bring a diverse skill set to the table. My ability to draw parallels between seemingly disparate disciplines and apply that knowledge to solve problems has been a key factor in my success both at UPS and on the Long Island Railroad Third Track Project.

I am particularly interested in SiriusXM because of the company's strong reputation as an innovator in the data analytics space. For instance, as the first major music platform to utilize users' analytics to drive advertising revenue and provide tailored user experiences, Pandora was a vanguard in the modern digitial broadcasting space. Even now, as the digital broadcasting sector becomes further saturate, SiriusXM is maintaining its position at the forefront of the industry thanks to its steadily increasing revenue and diverse array of products within that space (with holdings in digital radio, on-demand music services, and even podcasts--thanks to Stitcher).

As a product analyst, I know that identifying, confirming, and communicating trends will be critical to success. This is convenient because these skills were key aspects of my work at UPS and on the LIRR project: maintaining awareness of operational performance was critical and was carried out through easily-understandable reports, charts, and graphics. I've found that often the story told with data is more important than the data itself. Though my programming skills are self-taught, I have a strong understanding of product development workflows and I'm always improving my skills and knowledge through side projects such as the Mastodon server I'm currently hosting on Digital Ocean. Because of this, my background and drive to continuously improve make me a strong fit for the Product Analyst role at SiriusXM.

Thanks for taking the time to read this; I'm looking forward to the chance to discuss my qualifications further.

Best,


Alexander Swyst
